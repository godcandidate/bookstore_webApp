## Overview

The **Bookstore Web Application** is a modern eCommerce platform built using **React.js** to manage and sell books online. The application is containerized using **Docker**, deployed on **AWS EC2**, and managed through a robust **CI/CD pipeline** powered by **Jenkins**. It provides a seamless user experience with features like book listings, shopping cart functionality, and order management.



---

## Architecture

The application follows a microservices-based architecture, leveraging the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: A React js frontend.
- **Containerization**: Docker for packaging and deploying the application.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins automates the build, test, and deployment process.
- **Hosting**: AWS EC2 instance for hosting both the application and Jenkins server.

   ```

---

## Deployment

The application is deployed on an **AWS EC2 instance**. Here's how it works:

1. The source code is pushed to **GitHub**.
2. **Jenkins** pulls the latest code and triggers the CI/CD pipeline.
3. Jenkins builds a Docker image and pushes it to **Docker Hub** or **AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**.
4. Jenkins deploys the containerized application on the EC2 instance.
5. **Nginx** acts as a reverse proxy to manage incoming traffic.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is managed using **Jenkins** and consists of the following stages:

1. **Code Pull**: Jenkins pulls the latest code from the repository.
2. **Build**: Jenkins builds the Docker image.
3. **Test**: Automated tests are executed to ensure code quality.
4. **Push**: The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub/AWS ECR.
5. **Deploy**: Jenkins deploys the containerized application on the AWS EC2 instance.
